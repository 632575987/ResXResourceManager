To automate localization tasks a Scripting Module is available.

With this you can write Power Shell scripts that e.g.

* export and import resources to and from Excel files
* generate or load snapshots to export only changes compared to the last snapshot
* check your resources for untranslated strings during build

Download the Scripting Module from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/tom-englert/ResXResourceManager/releases) page and expand the zip file to a folder of your choice. 

The file Sample.ps1 that comes with the module shows how to use it for the most common tasks.
