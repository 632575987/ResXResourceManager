To speed up the localization process you can make use of automated translations.

Switch to the Translations tab to use this feature. If the translation service needs credentials, enter them in the translation engine configuration. Follow the link to the translation service to learn about the service specifics.
If you don't want to use a service, uncheck the "Enabled" switch. 

After selecting source and target language, all entires that have no translation in the target language will be displayed and the translation runs in the background. When the translation is complete, the results can be reviewed or edited before accepting the result.

All results can be reviewed by opening the combo box in the target column. The results are ordered by the quality of the translation that the service reports. If you had already a translation of the same term in your project, the quality is the number of occurrences of this translation. Existing translations will have a higher quality rank than translations by a service.
